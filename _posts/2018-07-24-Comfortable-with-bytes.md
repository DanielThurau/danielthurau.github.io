title: Getting Comfortable with Bytes
---

One great thing that my advanced databases class provided me was the ability to feel comfortable with bits and bytes. Sounds weird right? Of course I was comfortable with the concept of bits and bytes. You can't really graduate as a computer science major without being comfortable with them. But with the need to compress information effciently in a filesystem that doesn't support the implementation of records, I was forced to write serializers and de-serializers. Of course these are trivial concepts, but when you're dealing with objects that serialize to byte specific information you get fairly comfortable.

This might seem random, but when reading  Juho Snellman's [Optimizing a breadth-first search](https://humanreadablemag.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ab0f46cf302c0ed836e0bf0ad&id=7f98d317f6&e=528fbfb533), I think back to when I was afraid to operate on any data not located in memory using some provided type or on disk in some kind of string file. I now see how far I've come with the level of comfortableness of manipulating individual bits with some C/C++ black magic and feel proud but mostly it's crazy to see the level of improvement over the last six months. I'm curious to see what's in store for the next six months.
