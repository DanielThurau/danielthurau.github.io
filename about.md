For those looking for a deeper history of me (in somewhat chronological order)


- I grew up in New York solving Rubik’s cubes, modding Nerf Guns, building fantasy swords, and playing video games.
- In the summer before university, I took my dads advice on what to study and signed up for the Computer Engineering major at [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). I spent the rest of that summer running cables through data center floors in Hollywood.
- One week into University, I didn’t know the difference between Computer Science and Computer Engineering, so I switched my major to CS because I made more friends in those classes. This was a fateful decision.
- I really enjoyed academic Computer Science. I especially loved my systems classes. Operating Systems, Databases, Advanced Programming, and Computer Security were my favorites.
- During the school year, I had the privilege to work at the [Learning & Experimental Economics Projects Lab](https://ugr.ue.ucsc.edu/LEEPS). I got to work on a team and had my first encounter with serious software. We ran experiments on high-frequency trading markets.
- One summer, I interned at [Daystrom Technology Group](https://daystrom.com/about-us/). They took a huge chance on a young guy who didn’t know anything. I am forever thankful that they did. I wrote software that benchmarked their filesystems.
- Another summer I interned at NBCUniversal, where I wrote security applications like [nmap port probers](https://msadekuni.github.io/python-portscan/index.html#). I made some good friends there.
- My love for running servers started in my dorm room, continued on into my college apartments, and remains today. This obsession started when my dad said I should check out Ubuntu.
- My senior year I ran the software team for Rocket Club in its inaugural year at UCSC. I worked on integrating computer systems into the rocket sled, programming computer vision for object detection, and developing an automatic braking system.
- I graduated in 2018 and landed a job at Amazon on the Alexa Mobile team. I learned to build high-throughput, high resilience, low latency distributed systems on AWS. I also got to work on the forward deployment of a recommendation system, and the accompanying ML pipeline.
- The rest of my time at Amazon was spent honing my skills at Amazon F3’s grocery delivery.
- I enjoyed writing fun websites during this time. [ColorSplash](https://thurau.io/colorsplash/) was my favorite and inspired by my girlfriend.
- In 2021, I joined the [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/) Foundation's San Francisco office to work on the [Internet Computer Protocol](https://internetcomputer.org/). I loved its startup culture. I spent most of my time on the [Network Nervous System](https://internetcomputer.org/nns) team maintaining one of the most complex DAOs in the Web3 ecosystem.
- While there, I also got to start the [Service Nervous System](https://internetcomputer.org/sns) from scratch, which was an incredibly rewarding experience.
- In the winter of 2023, I was inspired to return to some of my roots when watching [Adam Savage](https://www.youtube.com/@tested), [Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere), [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/@casey), and [Scott Yu-Jan](https://www.youtube.com/@ScottYuJan). I converted my third bedroom to a home lab and bought a 3D printer. I mod Nerf Guns again, build overpowered potato cannons, and do lots of fun electronic projects.
- I still write fun software, like RAG bots for SNS knowledge and [Old School Runescape arbitrage programs](https://github.com/DanielThurau/osrs_high_alc_arbitrage).
- Recently, I've been [benchmarking my 3D printer](https://github.com/DanielThurau/Ender_3_Pro_Modeling_and_Benchmarking).
